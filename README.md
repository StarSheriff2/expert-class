## About
Expert Class API is the backend for a ***fully responsive*** web app that I built with a team of 4 members. The front end of the app is handled separately by another app. The [repo for the front-end is here](https://github.com/StarSheriff2/expert-class-frontend). The API documentation of this project was generated with the <strong>'rswag'</strong> gem. We built request and integration tests, achieving a 95% coverage. We use cross-site session cookies to handle user authentication. We use PostgreSQL as the database and Cloudinary to store all images in the cloud.

### API Documentation
We used Rswag to generate all the API documentation directly from our tests. You will find all the endpoints necessary to use our API here:
[Documentation](https://expert-class-production.up.railway.app/api-docs)

### Features:
- authenticate user
- create new user
- create and delete a class
- show all classes
- show all reserved classes
- reserve a class

### Front-end React app
- The front-end associated with this app is [here](https://expert-class-frontend-v2.netlify.app).

- The Github repo of the front-end is [here](https://github.com/StarSheriff2/expert-class-frontend).

### Live Demo

### Project Management

We used an agile methodology to manage all the tasks in this project. This project's tasks are described in [this kanban board](https://github.com/StarSheriff2/expert-class/projects/1).

We used GitHub's built-in Kanban board:
![kanban](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61250665/137405588-7fc8d606-5b01-43ca-beae-5c29ae231d2e.png)

## Setup and Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

#### Get files
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. If you do not have git installed in your system, skip this step and go to step 3; otherwise, go to the directory where you want to copy the project files and clone it by copying this text into your command prompt/terminal:
```
  git clone git@github.com:StarSheriff2/expert-class.git
```
  <br>

  *Now go to either the ***"Docker Deploy"*** or the ***"Local Deployt"*** section, depending on how you wish to deploy the API in your system.*

  <br>

3. Download the program files by clicking on the green button that says ‚Äú**Code**‚Äù on the upper right side of the project frame.
4. You will see a dropdown menu. Click on ‚Äú**Download ZIP**.‚Äù
5. Go to the directory where you downloaded the **ZIP file** and open it. Extract its contents to any directory you want in your system.

### Cloudinary Setup
> You will need a Cloudinary account to be able to deploy this app locally or through Docker. If you already have one, look for the **API Environment variable**, which you will find in your cloudinary dashboard:
> - for a Docker deployment, copy the **API Environment variable** into your .env file:

```bash
CLOUDINARY_URL=<your_unique_cloudinary_url>
```
> - for a local deployment, copy the **API Environment variable** into your *config/cloudinary.rb* file, by replacing the text "<cloudinary_url_here>" with the respective value of your **API Environment variable**

> ; otherwise, create a new account by going to Cloudinary and sign up for a free account: [https://cloudinary.com/](https://cloudinary.com/).

Once you have your new Cloudinary account set up, follow these steps:
1. Login with your new account
2. Go to your Cloudinary dashboard
3. Look for the **API Environment variable**
   ![cloudinary_yml_file](.github/images/cloudinary_setup_img.png)
4. Do the following:
   - for a local deployment, copy it into your *.env file*, like exaplained above
   - for a Docker deployment, copy it into your *config/cloudinary.rb* file like explained above


### Docker Deploy

#### Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10.22 or latest
- Docker Compose v2.15.1

#### Run

```bash
  docker compose up -d
```

### Local deploy

#### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.0.2p107
- Rails 6.1.4.1
- PostgreSQL 14
- Cloudinary account and cloudinary_url

#### Install Dependencies
1. If you are not in your system terminal/command prompt already, please open it and go to the directory where you cloned the remote repository or extracted the project files.
2. While in the project root directory, type
    ```
    bundle install
    ```
    This command will install all the necessary gems in your system.

### Database Setup

Run

```bash
bin/rails db:setup
```
This will create your local databases, load the schema, and initialize with the seed data.

**Note:** If you get an error after running this command, it might be because you don't have a database called ***"postgres"***. This happens because when you create a new Rails application, Rails uses this "postgres" database to create and manage the databases for your application. You can easily create one by running this command:
```bash
createdb postgres
```

If Rails still complains about not finding the "postgres" role, you can create one with super-user priviledges:
```bash
createuser -s postgres
```

Now try running the db:setup command again!

You are all set now!
## Usage

1. In your terminal, run
    ```bash
    bin/rails server
    ```
    while inside the root directory of the repository files

    **Note:** _This command will not stop on its own. To exit, hit "ctrl + c"_

2. The app allows API calls using curl or your favorite API client, such as Postman, HTTPPie or VS Code's Thunder Client. Here's a link to [HTTPIE](https://httpie.io).

## Development
### Testing
We created all types of tests for this project:
 - Unit / Model tests
 - Integration tests
 - API request tests

#### Coverage report
  ![test Coverage](.github/images/test_coverage_screenshot.png)

To run all tests, type this into command line:
```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

### Linters
To run ***Rubocop***, go to the root directory of your repository and copy/paste the following command into your terminal:
```
 rubocop .
```
